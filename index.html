      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of advanced learning techniques in medical imaging offers unique opportunities for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, limited data availability poses significant challenges, particularly for models requiring large datasets, leading to reduced generalizability and increased overfitting risk. This special session will address these challenges and explore strategies for extracting insights from small datasets. We will discuss methodologies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, active learning, and expert-driven annotations to enhance model performance. By emphasizing robust validation and interpretability, this session aims to advance medical imaging despite data limitations.

      <h2>Workshop Format</h2>
      <p>
        We estimate the number of submissions to be between 10 and 15. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. All submissions will undergo a single-blind peer-review process. Authors are required to designate a speaker upon submission. Each presentation will include significant discussion time, and we will encourage authors to prepare questions to stimulate interaction—either immediately after their talk or during a panel session.
