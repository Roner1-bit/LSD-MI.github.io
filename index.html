      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of advanced learning techniques in medical imaging offers unique opportunities for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, limited data availability poses significant challenges, particularly for models requiring large datasets, leading to reduced generalizability and increased overfitting risk. This special session will address these challenges and explore strategies for extracting insights from small datasets. We will discuss methodologies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, active learning, and expert-driven annotations to enhance model performance. By emphasizing robust validation and interpretability, this session aims to advance medical imaging despite data limitations.

      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        This special session addresses the pressing challenges posed by limited data availability in the medical imaging field, a critical area of research that directly impacts healthcare outcomes. The novelty of this session lies in its focus on innovative methodologies that leverage small datasets, including advanced techniques such as few-shot learning, uncertainty quantification, and the application of large language models (LLMs).
      </p>
      <p>
        As the demand for effective diagnostic tools continues to grow, the relevance of this session to the ADMA community is paramount. By fostering discussions on cutting-edge approaches and real-world applications, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations in healthcare. This session not only highlights the significance of data-driven solutions in medical imaging but also encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the insights gained from this session will equip ADMA2025 attendees with the tools and strategies necessary to navigate the complexities of data scarcity, ultimately enhancing the quality and accessibility of medical imaging solutions.

      <h2>Workshop Format</h2>
      <p>
        We estimate the number of submissions to be between 10 and 15. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. All submissions will undergo a single-blind peer-review process. Authors are required to designate a speaker upon submission. Each presentation will include significant discussion time, and we will encourage authors to prepare questions to stimulate interaction, either right after their talk or during a panel session. These components aim to create an engaging and collaborative atmosphere for exchanging ideas and promoting active dialogue in the context of small data in medical imaging.
